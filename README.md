# UI Gems

UI Gems is a place for designers and devs to get inspiration for building slick UI's. I handpicked and compiled all of the Gems myself and update them frequently. Get inspired ðŸ’Ž

UI Gems was built with an awesome package called GCN (see below).

### gatsby-starter-gcn

A starter template to build amazing static websites with Gatsby, Contentful and Netlify. Inspired by [gatsby-contentful-starter](https://github.com/contentful-userland/gatsby-contentful-starter).
